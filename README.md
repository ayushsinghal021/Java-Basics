# Java Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects that demonstrate various fundamental concepts and features of the Java programming language. These projects are suitable for intermediate-level Java learners and cover a wide range of topics.

## List of Experiments

1. **Prime Number Check**
    - Generate a random number up to 100 and print whether it is prime or not.

2. **Fibonacci Series and Factorial**
    - Generate the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci series.
    - Find the factorial of a given number using recursion.

3. **Array Operations**
    - Find the average and sum of an array of N numbers entered by the user.

4. **Rectangle Area and Perimeter**
    - Create a class to find out the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

5. **String Operations**
    - Design a class that performs string operations (equal, reverse the string, change case).

6. **Final Keyword Usage**
    - Demonstrate the use of the `final` keyword with data members, functions, and classes.

7. **Exception Handling**
    - Demonstrate the use of keywords `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`.

8. **Multi-threading**
    - Design a program to demonstrate multi-threading using the `Thread` class.

9. **Tic Tac Toe Game**
    - Design a program to create the game ‘Tic Tac Toe’.

10. **File Read and Write**
    - Design a program to read a text file and after printing that on the screen, write the content to another text file.

11. **Text File Analysis**
    - Design a program to count the number of words, characters, and vowels in a text file.
